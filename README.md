Title:
This project is titled Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL

Objective:
The objective of the project is to clean and transform a given raw data set to a new data set and answer business questions 
using the transformed data.

Process followed:
1. Visualizing and exploring the diffrent rows and column in the source file(CSV)
2.Loading of the files into a created database called ecommerce in postgres 
3.Further cleaning and exploration and transformation of the data was done in the database using different SQL queries.

Challenges:
Loading the provided data(csv files) into the database was a challenge.This took alot of time and after loading I was still having 
issues displaying all record from one of the tables in the database created(analytics table).

Future goals.
The data was not as clean as I would have wanted and this will defenitely 
affect the quality of the insight that the data will provide.
If there was more time ,I would have done more cleaning and transformation of the data to guarantee a better
 data Quality ready for analysis.
