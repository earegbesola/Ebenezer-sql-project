# Title:

 This project is titled Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL

# Objective:

The objective of the project is to clean and transform a given raw data set to a new data set and answer business questions 
using the transformed data.

# Process followed:

1.Visualizing and exploring the diffrent rows and column in the source file(CSV)

2.Loading of the files into a created database called ecommerce in postgres 

3.Further cleaning and exploration and transformation of the data was done in the database using different SQL queries.

4.Data QA consideration/process:

This is to guaranty the quality of data for the project as this ultimately determines the suitability and output of decisions made with the data.This was done to ensure that data characteristics like consistency,accuracy,Validity,completenes and uniqueness were assured.

# Challenges:

Loading the provided data(csv files) into the database was a challenge.This took alot of time and after loading I was still having 
issues displaying all record from one of the tables in the database created(analytics table).

# Some of the questions answered with the data include the following:

a.The product with the highest  sales by volume

b.products not in stock/discontinued

c.product sold with  the average least sentimentscore or negative perception/opinion by customers


# Future goals.

The data was not as clean as I would have wanted and this will defenitely 
affect the quality of the insight that the data will provide.
If there was more time ,
I would have done more cleaning and transformation of the data to guarantee a better data Quality ready for analysis.

I would have also considered using other data cleaning solution tools like python(+ data manipulation liabraries like Pandas) in combination with SQL as a combo for more efficient and effective way of cleaning the data.
